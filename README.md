# EarlyDetectionforGestationalDiabetes-

This repository hosts a robust Machine Learning pipeline designed to assist in the early screening of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). By synthesizing clinical biomarkers (Glucose, BMI, Blood Pressure) through a Soft Voting Ensemble, this tool aims to improve prediction recall over single-model approaches.

Key differentiators include an Explainable AI (XAI) layer using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), which provides clinicians with transparent "risk drivers" rather than black-box predictions, and an Optimized Decision Threshold tuned specifically to minimize false negatives in medical screening.
